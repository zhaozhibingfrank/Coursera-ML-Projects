Dear Zhibing, We’ve reviewed your application for an international experience award in support of your Spring 2018 work term in China. I’m happy to let you know that we are able to provide you with an International Experience Award in the amount of $1,000. These funds will be held and made available for you to use toward your Fall 2018 tuition fees. You will see the award listed on your Quest account under Anticipated Aid in late-July so that you can use it on a Promissory Note when arranging to pay your fees. Award conditions: If you are no longer pursuing the work experience as described in your award application, please contact our office so that we can allocate the funds to another deserving student. Your participation in this international experience may be subject to verification, and in the event that you do not pursue and/or complete this experience, the award may be cancelled or adjusted. Please be aware of your obligation to keep informed about travel advisories and warnings - seehttps://uwaterloo.ca/co-operative-education/travel-advisory If you have any questions, please let me know. Wishing you all the best
